Updated:
Use python to auto unpack(.py) game directory.

Create a .env file with a path to each directory you want to unpack. Depending on the type, it will automatically run the correct executable.

The unpack.py will download both vgmstream and ffmpeg to the local directory to perform the extra interaction of conversions to readable mp3 audio files.

Bug fix:
Updated the dotnet version
Added error handling for path length limits
